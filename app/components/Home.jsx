                    I am Full-Stack Software Developer with over 3+ Year's Experience and I want to make things that make a simple. Iâ€™ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me.
                    And I am always interested to work on back end as well as front end.
                    I currently work at Neosoft technologies where I develop dynamic application for the web using Node, Angular, Express, MongoDB, React, VueJs.
